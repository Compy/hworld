Registers your current nickname with services. After your nickname is registered, 
you will be able to register channels under your record and store multiple channel
access levels. Once registered, you must authenticate with services everytime you log
onto this IRC network, which is done by the AUTH command. 

Nicknames unused for 21 days will be automatically deregistered.
Pls write your nickname password down somewhere as once lost is very difficult to recover.

EXAMPLE: /msg %CS% REGISTER MySeCrEtPaSs
